Yii2 sentry component
=====================

Yii2 Sentry component allowing for unified array format passing parameters to Sentry log target and other log targets. The ability to pass arrays as the log message is suitable practice for
those who want to use Logstash, ElasticSearch, etc. for getting statistical inferences of these data later on.

## Install
```
php composer.phar require sheershoff/yii2-sentry-component:dev-master
```

In config file:

```php
'bootstrap' => ['log', 'raven'],
'components' => [
    'raven' => [
        'class' => 'sheershoff\sentry\ErrorHandler',
        'dsn' => '', // Sentry DSN
    ],
    'log' => [
        'targets' => [
            [
                'class' => 'sheershoff\sentry\Target',
                'levels' => ['error', 'warning'],
                'dsn' => '', // Sentry DSN
            ]
        ],
    ],
]
```

If application doesn't have `raven` component, the component will not try to send messages to sentry. This is useful for development environments, for example.

## Usage

Exceptions and PHP errors are caught without effort. Standart `Yii::(error|warning|info|trace)` logging works as usual, but you also can use the following format:

```php
Yii::warning([
    'msg' => 'SomeWarning', // event name that will be sent to Sentry
    'data' => [ // extra data for the event
        'userId' => Yii::$app->user->id,
        'someDataOnWarningSituation' => $controller->state,
        'modelThatCausedFailure' => $model->attributes,
    ],
], 'eventCategory');
```

Or you can replace this with `Log::warning` as in the exception example below, since the exception argument is not required. Notice that `eventCategory` is not sent to Sentry and is used only for log messages routing and filtering.

Wherever you need to log a caught exception with stacktrace and additional data, use

```php
use sheershoff\sentry\Log;
// some code here
try{
    $model1->save();
}catch (\Exception $e){
    Log::warning([
        'msg' => 'ExceptionWarning', // event name that will be sent to Sentry
        'data' => [ // extra data for the event
            'userId' => Yii::$app->user->id,
            'someDataOnWarningSituation' => $controller->state,
            'modelThatCausedFailure' => $model->attributes,
        ],
    ], 'exceptionCategory', $e);
}
```

There are proxy methods in `Log` for the four Yii static methods: `error`, `warning`, `info`, `trace`. If `$e` is not null the component expects that it is an exception and after calling the
corresponding Yii method also captures the exception for Sentry.

Also, the following use cases are possible:

```php
SentryHelper::extraData($task->attributes);
throw new Exception('unknown task type');
```

Or just capture a message with full stacktrace:

```php
try {
    throw new Exception('FAIL');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    SentryHelper::captureWithMessage('Fail to save model', $e);
}
```

## Other log targets

To use the power of the component you should keep in mind that other log targets will receive arrays instead of strings in the log message. You can create a proxy class, redefining `formatMessage` method of the parent LogTarget, e.g.:

```php
namespace common\components;
use Yii;
class SyslogJsonTarget extends \yii\log\SyslogTarget
{
	/**
	 * @inheritdoc
	 */
	public function formatMessage($message)
	{
		list($text, $level, $category, $timestamp) = $message;
		$level = \yii\log\Logger::getLevelName($level);
		if (!is_string($text)) {
			$text = \yii\helpers\Json::encode($text);
		} else {
			$text = \yii\helpers\Json::encode(['rawstring' => $text]);
		}
		$prefix = $this->getMessagePrefix($message);
		return "{$prefix}[$level][$category] $text";
	}
}
```

## Data precautions

*  Avoid passing resources and objects that can not be serialized in the array or rewrite formatMessage to handle that, e.g. trying to serialize PDO instance will raise fatal PHP error. Native Yii log targets will try to serialize that. One can check <http://github.com/raven/raven> to see how it sanitizes and handles these cases and use it's static methods.
*  Also check how raven can filter out private data such as password or sensitive financial requisites.
